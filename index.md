## Duke Visualization Challenge

Scholars@Duke and The Graduate School of Duke University invited researchers and data scientists to participate in a [visualization challenge](https://rc.duke.edu/scholars-vis-challenge/) to address questions like:

- Can faculty publications and PhD dissertation committees show how disciplines overlap?
- What can the makeup of dissertation committees tell us about trends in research?
- How many Duke faculty cross departmental and school boundaries in their publishing and teaching activities, and can these activities be visualized?
 
My collaborator [Varda](https://github.com/vfaghirh) (at Arizona State University) and I teamed up along with Python, many of its libraries and Gephi to present a poster at the symposium. Our results got lots of attentions, won 3rd place, and appeared in Duke News.

Let me walk you through the results briefly! Ready?? There are three main parts: Publications, collaborations, and education!
You see some description on the poster. Here I am going to focus on the neworks!

In our bigger collaboration network, the nodes represent organization and departments, with the outer circle being the most important ones (largest degree nodes)! Most of these important ones are affiliated with Duke school of Medicine.

On a coarse-grain level, we also have plotted collaboration network of schools. Still school of Medicine and basic sciences rock, but take a closer look and you see how connected law school and school of public policy are! Right? kind of amazing how collaborative publications are! If you want to explore more do not miss [out our interactive graph](https://aghilzadeh.github.io/Duke_Collaborations/)! Still need more details? You can always refer to our codes, methodes and abstract files!
