## Duke Visualization Challenge

Scholars@Duke and The Graduate School of Duke University invited researchers and data scientists to participate in a [visualization challenge](https://rc.duke.edu/scholars-vis-challenge/) to address questions like:

- Can faculty publications and PhD dissertation committees show how disciplines overlap?
- What can the makeup of dissertation committees tell us about trends in research?
- How many Duke faculty cross departmental and school boundaries in their publishing and teaching activities, and can these activities be visualized?
 
My collaborator [Varda](https://github.com/vfaghirh) (at Arizona State University) and I teamed up along with Python, many of its libraries and Gephi to present a poster at the symposium. Our results got lots of attentions, won 3rd place, and appeared in Duke News.

Our Poster, which I designe using Inkscape, is now in Duke's Library and can be cited. You can see the abstract [here](http://hdl.handle.net/10161/16026/).

Let me walk you through the results briefly! Ready?? There are three main parts: Publications, collaborations, and education!
You see some description on the poster. Here I am going to focus on the networks!

In our bigger collaboration network, the nodes represent organization and departments, with the outer circle being the most important ones (largest degree nodes)! Most of these important ones are affiliated with Duke school of Medicine.

On a coarse-grain level, we also have plotted collaboration network of schools. Still school of Medicine and basic sciences rock, but take a closer look and you see how connected law school and school of public policy are! Right? Kind of amazing how collaborative publications are! On the other hand, Divinity school is isolated. It was not like this few hundred years ago, I believe! If you want to explore more do not miss out our [collaborations interactive graph](https://aghilzadeh.github.io/Duke_Collaborations/)! 

In the education graph, we want to show where students go to pick up their graduale level committee members. The inner circle are departments, where students have graduated from 2012 to 2017, and outer circles are faculties affiliations. The edges represent the number of students. Lots of students love faculties from Trinity College of Arts and Sciences. Here basic sciences are connected more than medical sciences or even engineering. If you need to take a closer look try our [education interactive graph](https://aghilzadeh.github.io/Duke_Education/)!

Still need more details? You can always refer to our codes, methods and abstract [files](https://github.com/AghilZadeh/Duke_DataVisualization)!
